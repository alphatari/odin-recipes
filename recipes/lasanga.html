    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>1 Yellow Onion</li>
        <li>1 28oz. can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 oz. tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk ricotta</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <li>Add the Italian sausage to a deep skillet
            and cook over medium heat until browned. 
            While the sausage is cooking, dice the onion 
            and then add it to the skillet with the sausage. 
            Continue to stir and cook until the onion has softened.
        </li>

        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, 
            and Italian seasoning to the skillet and stir to combine.
            Partially cover the skillet with a lid, turn the heat down to medium-low, 
            and let the sauce simmer while you prepare the other 
            ingredients. Stir the saue occasionally as it cooks.
        </li>

        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350ÂºF. Add the ricotta cheese,
            Italian cheese blend, egg, and pepper to a bowl,
            then stir to combine. Set the cheese mixture aside.
        </li>

        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water and add 1/2 tbsp salt.
            Bring the pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add
            the lasanga noodles and cook just until tender. Drain
            the noodles in a colander.
        </li>

        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <li>Spread about 1 cup of sauce over the bottom of 
            a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Lay three lasanga noodles
            on top of the sauce. Spread 1/3 of the cheese mixture
            evenly over the noodles. Repeat the layers two more times.
            Finish with the remaining sauce, then top with thh shredded mozzarella.
        </li>

        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <li>Cover the lasanga with foil and bake for 40 minutes.
            After 40 minutes, remove the foil, turn the oven from
            bake to broil, and broil for about 5 minutes or just
            until the cheese gets a little brown on top.
            Watch the lasanga closely as it broils!
        </li>

        <h4>Step 7</h4>
        <li>Top the lasagna with chopped parsley if desired.
            Slice the lasanga into nine pieces and serve!
